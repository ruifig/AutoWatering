# XPT2046 Touchscreen Arduino Library

Simple XPT2046 Arduino Library.

This was heavily based on https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/XPT2046_Touchscreen .
Changes were made according to my needs and for my own projects.

Some day I' might write proper documentation.

A few notes:

* At the time of writting, this has only been tested with Raspberry Pi Pico / Pico W using the [https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico](Arduino-Pico)
* No guarantee whatsoever this will work for you.
